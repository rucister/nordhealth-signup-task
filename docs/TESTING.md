# 🧪 Testing Strategy & Documentation

## 📊 Testing Overview

Our authentication system has comprehensive test coverage across three levels:

- **🔧 Unit Tests**: 25 tests for pure validation functions  
- **🎨 Component Tests**: 10 tests for UI component behavior
- **🔗 Integration Tests**: 11 tests for composable interactions
- **📈 Total Coverage**: 46 tests ensuring system reliability

## 🎯 Coverage Goals

| Metric | Threshold | Current |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Lines | 80% | ✅ |
| Functions | 80% | ✅ |
| Branches | 80% | ✅ |
| Statements | 80% | ✅ |

## 🏃 Running Tests

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests once
pnpm test:run

# Run with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Interactive UI
pnpm test:ui

# Watch mode for development
pnpm test:watch
```

### Targeted Testing
```bash
# Run only unit tests
pnpm test:unit

# Run only component tests  
pnpm test:component

# Run only integration tests
pnpm test:integration

# CI mode with verbose output
pnpm test:ci
```

## 📁 Test Structure

```
tests/
├── setup.ts                    # Global test configuration
├── unit/
│   └── validation.test.ts      # Pure function tests (25 tests)
├── components/
│   └── PasswordStrength.test.ts # Component behavior tests (10 tests)
└── integration/
    └── useFormValidation.test.ts # Composable integration tests (11 tests)
```

## 🔧 Test Categories

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
Testing pure validation functions in isolation:
- ✅ Email validation with regex patterns
- ✅ Password strength requirements
- ✅ Required field validation  
- ✅ Password confirmation matching
- ✅ Custom field name handling
- ✅ Edge cases and error conditions

### Component Tests (`tests/components/`)
Testing Vue components with proper mocking:
- ✅ PasswordStrength component rendering
- ✅ Visual strength indicators (weak → strong)
- ✅ Nord Design System integration
- ✅ Reactive prop updates
- ✅ CSS custom properties
- ✅ Accessibility considerations

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`)
Testing composable behavior and interactions:
- ✅ Form validation composable initialization
- ✅ Real-time vs event-driven validation
- ✅ Error state management
- ✅ Field-specific validation
- ✅ Password confirmation workflows
- ✅ Reactive validity updates

## 🛠️ Testing Tools

### Core Testing Stack
- **Vitest**: Fast unit test runner with TypeScript support
- **@vue/test-utils**: Vue component testing utilities
- **happy-dom**: Lightweight DOM simulation
- **@vitest/ui**: Interactive testing interface
- **@vitest/coverage-v8**: Code coverage reporting

### Coverage Reporting
- **HTML Reports**: Visual coverage analysis
- **LCOV Reports**: CI/CD integration
- **JSON Reports**: Programmatic analysis
- **Text Reports**: Terminal output

## 🎨 Testing UI

Launch the interactive testing interface:

```bash
pnpm test:ui
```

Features:
- 🔍 **Real-time test filtering** by name/file
- 📊 **Visual coverage reports** with highlighting
- ⚡ **Live test re-running** on file changes
- 🎯 **Test performance metrics** and timing
- 🔧 **Debugging tools** with error inspection

## 📈 Coverage Analysis

Generate detailed coverage reports:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

This creates:
- `coverage/index.html` - Interactive HTML report
- `coverage/lcov.info` - CI/CD integration format
- Terminal summary with pass/fail indicators

### Coverage Exclusions
- Configuration files (`*.config.*`)
- Test files (`tests/**`)
- Type definitions (`**/*.d.ts`)
- Build outputs (`dist/**`, `.nuxt/**`)
- Node modules and dependencies

## 🚀 CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ **Automated testing** on push/PR
- ✅ **Multi-node testing** (Node 18.x, 20.x)
- ✅ **Coverage reporting** with Codecov
- ✅ **PR coverage comments** with thresholds
- ✅ **Build validation** after tests pass

### Quality Gates
- **80% coverage minimum** across all metrics
- **All tests must pass** before merge
- **Linting checks** with ESLint
- **Build verification** in CI environment

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### TDD Approach
1. **Red**: Write failing test for new feature
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining tests

### Watch Mode Development
```bash
pnpm test:watch
```
- 🔄 **Auto-reruns** tests on file changes
- ⚡ **Fast feedback** during development
- 🎯 **Targeted testing** of modified files

### Debugging Tests
```bash
# Run specific test file
pnpm test tests/unit/validation.test.ts

# Run tests matching pattern
pnpm test --grep "password"

# Run with detailed output
pnpm test --reporter=verbose
```

## 📋 Testing Checklist

Before committing code:
- [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm test:run`)
- [ ] Coverage thresholds met (`pnpm test:coverage`)
- [ ] No linting errors (`pnpm lint`)
- [ ] New features have tests
- [ ] Edge cases covered
- [ ] Error conditions tested

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Test Organization
- **Descriptive test names** explaining behavior
- **AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert
- **Single responsibility** per test case
- **Meaningful test data** avoiding magic values

### Mocking Strategy
- **Mock external dependencies** (APIs, modules)
- **Keep components isolated** with proper mocking
- **Mock Nord Design System** for component tests
- **Avoid mocking system under test**

### Performance
- **Fast tests** with minimal setup
- **Parallel execution** where possible
- **Targeted testing** during development
- **Efficient watchers** for rapid feedback

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Phase 3: E2E Testing
- Playwright integration for full user workflows
- Cross-browser testing automation
- Visual regression testing
- Performance testing

### Phase 4: Advanced Testing
- Property-based testing with fast-check
- Mutation testing for test quality
- Contract testing for API integration
- Load testing for performance validation
